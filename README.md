Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I have been coding the world for over 40 years and the Web for over 27 years. I prefer to code by hand to avoid bloat (I cut my teeth on an IBM System/24 with 256Kb Ram and 256Mb hard drive - no room for duplicated code ðŸ˜„).
As a keen home computer enthusiast in the 70's, using bulletin boards, I became a very early adopter of the Internet, and used the Mosaic Browser from its first release in 1993. My 9600 baud dial up home connection was one of the first in South Africa outside of academia and large business. The bug bit. By 1995 I was busy installing the Internet in the company that I worked for and looking to venture out on my own, into this exciting new realm. This happened in 1996, when I left the corporate world and opened one of the first internet cafes in my area.
I have developed software for the PC since 1978, long before DOS and Microsoft. With the advent of Windows, I embraced the GU interface and so started my journey with Microsoft and Visual Basic, from Version 1 to .Net.
I still code in VB.Net for speedy crude solutions, but my passion is web-based business solutions.
Coding in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP on the back-end I have developed many systems for clients from online bus ticket sales catering for â€˜hop-on, hop-offâ€™ seat availability and interfacing to their in-house booking system to a company wide solution for a Tombstone manufacturer. Unfortunately, neither are open source and the latter software is licenced to other manufacturers in a kind of SAAS type business model.
I have also written a few hybrid mobile apps using Cordova. Single Page applications taking the power of the modern browsers and service workers to combine into an awesome way to deliver almost native type application at a fraction of the cost, is to me a no brainer.
I am back in the corporate world at the moment, helping to bring Mozambique medical aid and medical services into the 21st century.
I am a typical programmer who hates to do things twice ðŸ¤”. To that end I have created a number of small libraries of code to reduce the time that it takes to do the repetitive things. I have meddled with React, Vue, etc. but it would seem that there will always be a new flavour of framework to learn and I am far to busy to jump from one to another. I also avoid JQuery were possible as I believe that it hides the true power of JavaScript.
I follow a number of mentors on YouTube, Brad at Traversy Media being the main source of my inspiration and learning, but Kevin Powell for CSS, codeSTACKr, freeCodeCamp and others have all helped me in my quest to improve my skills.
I have decided to Open Source most of my simple libraries, one at a time, to see if they are of use to any one else and to get help in updating my 1980â€™s coding style which still permeates through to my code today (I have only recently got used to long field names, older languages such as RPGII, limited you to 6-8 characters).
